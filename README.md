# Multi-source_Illumination_optimization_VMM

The algorithm is developed to accurately and precisely inspect the semiconductor dimensions. The first part of the algorithm helps to optimize the feature orientation and the second part of it will optimize the multi-source illumination condition.
The results show the AI based optimization to predict the suitable lighting conditions to perform a highly accurate geometric feature measurement using vision measurement system.

The results supressed the uncertainties from 16 mirons to 0.16 microns.

The code and the dataset is made available on request.
